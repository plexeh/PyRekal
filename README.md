# PyRekal
GoPro management over wifi in Python
---

This is a project into looking at what's possible with the GoPro camera's web interface. I'm interested in working with high frame rate video and multiple cameras.
As I'm working towards some very specific goals, to save some time in getting to base functionality first some things not related to my goals like working with timelapse other camera unrelated functions will be left out until I get the basics down.

In case you were wondering this thing is named after the fictional Rekal Corporation from We Can Remember It For You Wholesale; mostly because of the title of the story I suppose, not so much the contents (ok maybe a little bit).

## Basic Functionality goals:
 1. Control shutter button - done
 2. Control power button - done
 3. Change capture settings
 4. View camera status - mostly there
 5. download videos - done
 6. clear camera 
 7. re-encode video at 25 fps
 8. more configuration options
 9. multiple camera control
 10. GUI
 11. run videos out of application rather than from file browser
 12. informational overlay on video (time, etc.)

There's a lot of work to do and currently my code is quite frankly, a noodly mess.
I'm sorry. (Honest!)
